##2739 is to make a multiplication table.

n = int(input())

for i in range(1,10):  # 1~9
    print(n, '*', i, '=', n*i)

#1330 is a comparison between two integers.
A,B = map(int,input().split())

if A > B:
    print('>') # when the 'if' conditional expression is true.
elif A < B:
    print('<') # when the 'elif' is true and 'if' is not true.
else:
    print('==')# when the above all is false.
